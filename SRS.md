## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "GuessWhere". The first chapter deals with some general information and basic things. In the second chapter we want to give an overview of the plan and vision we have. We also have have to figure out the dependencies that might come up during the project. The third chapter delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. This document will be updated multiple times during the project. We will add more and more information soon.

### 1.2 Scope
This application will be a game for Android devices. A random picture from all over the world will be shown in the app. The user has to guess where this picture was taken. After making the guess the result shows the distance between the origin location and the guessed location from the user. The goal of the game is to achieve the lowest possible distance between the origin and the guessed location. The locations are visualized with a map like Google Maps. 

Planned Subsystems are: 
* The Game:  
The game is the essential part of the app. Game sessions should be visualized as postings including relevant information about the session. Those should be partly standardized by a form with a free text option for specifics. The data must be stored accordingly.

* Account System:  
Users can create accounts to save their progress made in the game. User data must be stored alongside the posting data. Username and password can be changed in the options-window.

* Friend List:  
Once the account system is created there will be the option to mark users as favorites.

* User Ranking:
There should be a leaderboard for users to compare themselves amongst each other.

* Storing Data:  
  User data for accounts and possibly profiles has to be stored. Also game statistics have to be stored in order to be used for the leaderboard.

* Multiple User Games
  User can play against each other. After User 1 has guessed, the same picture will be shown to the second user. After the second user also guessed the location the results will be presented to both users. The user who guessed the location with the lowest distance wins.

### 1.5 Overview

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
The app we want to create is a game where you are shown a picture from somewhere around the world and you have to point somewhere on the world map where you think this location is. The closer you are the more points you get. We were inspired by several other games that are similar to our idea. Most of these are either browser games or are badly implemented f.e. with lots of ads or paylocked-content. We plan to create this without those "features".

## 2.2 Product perspective
In addition to the game, we want to implement several other features that are supposed to make the game experience even better. Those are for example a general account system, a database, a leaderboard and friendslist and a challange other users feature.

### 2.3 User characteristics
The user needs a modern Android Device. We will build this app for Android Smartphone not for tablets. In order to play a game the user must create an account. This account can be created by defining a username and set a password. A user is defined by a Username, an unchangeable ID, a score and a list of ID's they're friends with. These values are stored in our database.

### 2.4 Dependencies
The main dependency is the Android version the app should support. With every major Android version Google makes some changes that might effect our code. Our goal is to support the modern Android versions (9 and 10).

## 3. Specific Requirements
### 3.1 Functionality
This section explains all of the functional requierements and the order in which we plan to implement them.
3.1.1 The Game
3.1.2 Interface
3.1.3 User accounts
3.1.4 Database
3.1.5 Statistics
3.1.6 Leaderboard
3.1.7 Friends
Possibly:
3.1.8 A versus mode (multiplayer)
3.1.9 A chat function

#### 3.1.1 The Game
First we need to create a running app in which you can play the game we described above. This process will probably take the longest. Therefore we need a use-case to start a new game. This is a crucial use-case! [Use-Case Start Game](https://github.com/Eightdays1/guesswhere_doc/blob/master/UseCases/Use-Case_StartGame.md)

After starting, we also need a use-case for the actual game. The next picture shows the use-case 'Game'. [Use-Case Game](https://github.com/Eightdays1/guesswhere_doc/blob/master/UseCases/Use-Case_Game.md)

#### 3.1.2 Interface
Once the game is running an interface needs to be created. This includes thing like buttons labeled with 'Play', 'Settings', etc.

#### 3.1.3 User accounts
Next the possibility of creating accounts and saving your data will be implemented. This forms the basis for the steps 4 to 10.

#### 3.1.4 Database
The data collected through the user accounts needs to be stored in a central, accesible place. For this we'll connect the app to a database. The picture below shows the database-schema.
![OUCD](https://github.com/Eightdays1/guesswhere_doc/blob/master/images/Datenbankschema.jpg)

#### 3.1.5 Options
The userÂ´s should be able to change there username or password in the 'Options-Window'. Future options can be implemented in the window later. [Use-Case Options](https://github.com/Eightdays1/guesswhere_doc/blob/master/UseCases/Use-Case_Options.md)

#### 3.1.6 Statistics
Once the database is running, the user should be able to access it. This will be visible in a statistics window. [Use-Case Statistics](https://github.com/Eightdays1/guesswhere_doc/blob/master/UseCases/Use-Case_Statistics.md)

#### 3.1.7 Leaderboard
From there the database and the statistics can be accessed. With this basis we'll create a leaderboard which all users can look at.

#### 3.1.8 Friends
User's should be able to be friends with other players. At first this only makes it easier to look at each others stats. In chapter 3.1.8 the function of a versus mode may be added.

#### 3.1.9 Versus mode
Like in other apps (f.e. Quizduell) a versus mode shall be implemented. In ~3 rounds the players will take turns to guess their location. At the end a winner is declared. [Use-Case Challenge User](https://github.com/Eightdays1/guesswhere/blob/main/Use-Case_Challenge_User.md)

#### 3.1.10 Chat function
The least important feature is the chat function. Users should be able to communicate with each other in versus mode. If there is time left, this will be implemented as well.

### 3.2 Reliability
To Be Determined

#### 3.2.1 Availability
We will not host a webservice to provide data for the game. All the data needed to play the game are already implemented in the actual android-application.

#### 3.2.3 Accuracy
To Be Determined

### 3.3 Performance

#### 3.3.1 Response time
We are not tied to any conditions for the response time. But in order to actually be playable, we need to provide a lagfree and fast response game experience.

#### 3.3.2 Storage
The storage space is limited and usually very limited on smartphone. The storage-space needed will mostly depends of the playable maps included in the first place.

#### 3.3.3 Capacity
To Be Determined 

#### 3.3.4 Resource utilization
